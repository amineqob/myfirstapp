<!--There is two type of branches the one is the main called master and the other you just name it
as part of the main branche like the login form in certain project
so to prevent the uncessary changes to the main code of project and you want just the loginform branch
you create a branch called the login form instructions :
1- git branch loginbranch
2- git commit -m "login changes"
3- git checkout loginbranch
4- so when you switch by git checkout master the file you created in the login branch will disapear because
you switched to master and any modification you add on the main code will disapear too
and if you are finished with the loginbranch modification and you want to merge it with the main branch master
you do this git merge loginbranch
